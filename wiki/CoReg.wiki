#Tab for batch Running Elastix

=Registration Tab=

Batch image registration and warping is one of the helpful functionalities of VRAK. Elastix/Transformix is the command-line program that does all the leg work. However, it can be quite time-consuming when used to manually align and resample fused PET/CT or SPECT/CT images (particularly to an unfamiliar user). The VRAK batch registration takes care of the following steps:
  * Rigidly Register CT images
  * Deformably Register CT images
  * Warp Fused SPECT/PET images
  * Resample SPECT/PET images to 5mm cubic voxels (as mhd+raw filetype)
  * Rename images to user-selected values (mhd+raw files & edit _'ElementDataFile'_ flag in mhd header)
  * Autopopulates image paths in the _Dosimetry Input_ tab
